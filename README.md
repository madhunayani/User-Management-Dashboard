## ⚙️ Getting Started: Setup & Installation

To get this project running on your local machine, follow these simple steps. You will need to run the backend and frontend in two separate terminals.

### 1. Backend Server

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server (runs on http://localhost:8080)
npm start
```

### 2. Frontend Application

```bash
# Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the React application (opens http://localhost:3000 in your browser)
npm start
```

Once both servers are running, the application will be live in your browser!

## 📡 API Endpoints

The backend provides the following RESTful API endpoints to manage users.

| Method | Endpoint          | Description               |
| :----- | :---------------- | :------------------------ |
